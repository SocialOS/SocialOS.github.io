SocialOS 
Ver. 0.0.0.0202a

Welcome to the SocialOS Project.  

The world runs on a SocialOS and, over the years, has had various components of it upgraded. 

For example: post mail was upgraded to email, gold has been upgraded to fiat (and recently 
has been undergoing an upgrade to crypto).  Applications like NextDoor, Facebook, Twitter, 
Uber, Venmo, Amazon, Etsy, TikTok, and so forth all can be considered upgrades.  

This project is dedicated to identifying and taking next steps to enable 
society to upgrade itself without regard for borders, creed, race, or location
in order to root our existence in our collective humanity.
